Machine was set up and it posted fine
Installed ESXi iso on thumb drive
Thumb drive booted on new system
Tried to install esxi on system
    
    No Network Adapters found
    https://www.v-front.de/p/esxi-customizer-ps.html
        have to make my own custom esxi iso with NIC drivers for my NIC
        NiC: RealtekÂ® RTL8111H
            Downloaded vib and zop
            Downloaded offline bundle in downloads folder 201712001.zip
        Have to install Vmware powerCli https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/VMware.PowerCLI/10.0.0.7895300
        
        Need to make custom ISO with nic drivers
        if this does not work need to go buy a supported  

        It worked


         Put ESXi650-201712001.zip - offline bundle
         & net55-r8168-8.045-napi-offline_bundle.zip - nic drivers inside Packages folder

         then ran from downloads folder C:\Users\Edward\Downloads\:
         .\ESXi-Customizer-PS-v2.5.1.ps1 -pkgdir 'C:\Users\Edward\Downloads\Packages\'

        wrote new custom iso to thumb drive

        Booted ISO and installed esxi on an extra cheap thumb drive

        error with iso i think i used the wrong downloaded zip package from vmware.com

        downloaded ESXi650-201701001.zip and combined with network drivers and this worked using 
          .\ESXi-Customizer-PS-v2.5.1.ps1 -pkgdir 'C:\Users\Edward\Downloads\Packages\'

        esxi is installed on the cheap kingston drive now

set esxi static ip to 10.0.0.200

can now access vmware at https://10.0.0.200/

create raid array 0 with asus motherboard
this didn work so got a raid controller card
    raid controller card = hardware raid
    mobo raid = software raid
got a intel nic because i was at the store

got esxi setup and talking to my network

    There is a lot more about setting up vm's and using esxi correctly, but once you are into the web console its pretty straight forward

    setup linux mint vm for plex server and created 2 virtual disks one with 80gb for OS and 1.5tb for media, full raid 0 array is about 6tb in total, so there is room for expansion.
     the plex vm media will take up the most of the space.
